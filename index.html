<p style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';color:red" > Hello anyone who has stumbled upon this page, my name is Michael Irlandez, a first year at RMIT, studying for a Bateleurs degree in Information technology. The secondary school that I attended was Rosehill Secondary Collage, in Niddrie. I am currently 18 years old (2021) birthday on the 2nd of December. I am 7/8ths Filipino and 1/8 Torres Strait Islander. My parents speak Tagalog (the language of the Philippines), I never learnt how to speak it, so English is my first and only language.</p>

<h2 style ="color:black"> one intersting tid bit about me</h2>
<p style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';color:red"> One somewhat interesting thing about me is that I collect Yu-Gi-Oh! Cards. I haven’t competed in any sort of official tournaments or anything, but I have considered it in the past. i only recently started collecting again in 2019 and now, its almost a problem… at least I don’t need to worry about paying rent or buying food, living with my mum and all (for now).</p>
